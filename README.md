## Issues ##

If you find any issues feel free to open a request in [the Issues tab](https://github.com/flubs-stuff/ionic4-binary-search-login/issues). If I have the time I will try to solve any issues but cannot make any guarantees. Feel free to contribute yourself. But honestly, with this type of project are the bugs not just free features?

### Demo ###

Run `npm install` to get packages required for the demo and then run `ionic serve` to run locally.
